<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Small and big ideas in digital health and social care are making a difference every day. We are bringing together those interested in using digital solutions and technologies to address everyday problems and challenges working in the South West of England. We had an exciting day of masterclasses and presentations with lots of opportunities for discussions in June 2018 at University of Exeter.
</p>
<p>We are now continuing the conversations focussing in on machine learning and user experience to start off with. If you would like to join our conversations, masterclasses and workshops, please sign up for updates here.
